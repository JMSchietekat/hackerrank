## Objective

Today we're expanding our knowledge of Strings and combining it with what we've already learned about loops. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task

Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N - 1 , print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

**Note**: 0 is considered to be an even index.

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer,  (the number of test cases).
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contain a String, .

## Constraints

* 1 <= T <= 10
* 2 <= lenght of S <= 10000

## Output Format

For each String Sj (where 0 <= j <= T - 1), print Sj's even-indexed characters, followed by a space, followed by Sj 's odd-indexed characters.
