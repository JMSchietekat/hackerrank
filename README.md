# HackerRank
This is my first **open source** code base. This is nothing ground breaking or profound, it is mearly a repository for the small challanges [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) has to offer.

The small challanges is a good way to pick up a new language or just practice one you are a bit rusty with.
